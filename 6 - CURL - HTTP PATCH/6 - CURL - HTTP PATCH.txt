The PATCH method is used to make partial updates to the resource on the server.
Note: For a PATCH request, we don't have to provide all data. We only send the data we want updated.

To send a curl PATCH request we use the option -X PATCH.

curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"userId\" : 456, \"title\" : \"New Dummy\"}"  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/200

Output

{
  "userId": 456,
  "id": 200,
  "title": "New Dummy",
  "completed": false
}

Notice how we are only sending the body with “New Dummy” as we are doing a partial update.
